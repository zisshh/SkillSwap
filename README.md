```

Run frontend

```bash
npm run dev
```

The frontend will be running on `http://localhost:5173`

### Backend Setup

```bash
cd ../Backend; npm install
```

Create .env file in the frontend and write the following:

```env
PORT = 8000
CORS_ORIGIN = *
MONGODB_URI = mongodb+srv://<your-username>:<your-password>@cluster0.<your-project>.mongodb.net

CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME = <your-cloudinary-cloud-name>
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY = <your-cloudinary-api-key>
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET = <your-cloudinary-api-key>

GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID = <your-google-client-id> 
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET = <your-google-client-secret>
GOOGLE_CALLBACK_URL=http://localhost:8000/auth/google/callback

JWT_SECRET = <your-jwt-secret>

EMAIL_ID = <your-email-id>
APP_PASSWORD = <your-app-password>
```

Run backend

```bash
npm run dev
```

The frontend will be running on `http://localhost:8000`

### Install and Setup through Docker

Create a docker-compose.yml file in SkillSwap folder. Write the following in it.

```yml
version: '3'

services:
  backend:
    build:
      context: .
      dockerfile: Dockerfile.backend
      args:
        PORT: 8000
        CORS_ORIGIN: "*"
        MONGODB_URI: "mongodb+srv://<your-username>:<your-password>@cluster0.<your-project>.mongodb.net"
        CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME: "<your-cloudinary-cloud-name>"
        CLOUDINARY_API_KEY: "<your-cloudinary-api-key>"
        CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET: "<your-cloudinary-api-key>"
        GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID: "<your-google-client-id>"
        GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET: "<your-google-client-secret>"
        GOOGLE_CALLBACK_URL: "http://localhost:8000/auth/google/callback"
        JWT_SECRET: "<your-jwt-secret>"
    ports:
      - "8000:8000"

  frontend:
    build:
      context: .
      dockerfile: Dockerfile.frontend
      args:
        VITE_LOCALHOST: "http://localhost:8000"
        VITE_SERVER_URL = "<your-deployment-link>"
    ports:
      - "5173:5173"
```

Run the docker compose file by using the following command which will run both frontend and backend.

```bash
sudo docker-compose up
```
